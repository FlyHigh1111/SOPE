Projetos realizados para SOPE em 2020/2021

## Rules:
https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#General_Naming_Rules
 - Filenames should be all lowercase and can include underscores (_)
    > like_this.c
 - The names of all types — classes, structs, type aliases, enums, and type template parameters — should start with a capital letter and have a capital letter for each new word. No underscores.
    > LikeThis
 - The names of variables (including function parameters) are all lowercase, with underscores between words.
    > like_this
 - Functions should start with a capital letter and have a capital letter for each new word.
    > LikeThis()

 - Avoid defining macros, especially in headers; prefer inline functions, enums, and const variables.

 - Comment the code. 
 - Implementations comments, in .c files, use:
    > //this is a comment. 
 - Functions descriptions, in header files, use:
    > /** <br>
    >  *This is a funtion description. <br>
    >  *@param f: variable description <br>
    >  *@return int: what does the function returns? <br>
    >  */
